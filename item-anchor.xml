        <p>For most sailors, anchors simply serve as a way to keep boats in one place. Some, however, rise far above their shipmates in ability. They are stronger, meaner, and crustier than their compatriots. These are the men and women who cast aside traditional arms and wield the ship's anchor itself in times of conflict, striking fear into all those who gaze upon them.</p>
        <p>An anchor with a chain that has a reach of 20 feet.</p>
        <p><strong>Special</strong></p>
        <p>An anchor, although unwieldy, can serve as a makeshift shield due to its shear size and weight. The wielder gains a +1 bonus to their AC while wielding this weapon.</p>
